      <h3>Moving to Portland</h3>
      <p>
        I moved to Portland in Late September, 2014. I wanted to get out of the cold of Alaska. I used to live in Oregon and I visited Portland once before. It's a stylish looking town. It's a little bit weird and I like that.

      <h3>Finding an Apartment</h3>
      <p>
        My sister was nice enough to let me stay at here place while I searched for an apartment. I woke up early every morning to call apartments. I had actually been calling apartments for months while I was still in Alaska. I finally got a call after about a month about a possible opening. An apartment I had called was nice enough to call me and tell about it.

      <h3>Doing things in Portland</h3>
      <p>I really like Karaoke. Or I did at the time I moved here. My voice has had real problems no thanks to acid reflux. Anyways one of the first bars I did Karaoke was at the Boiler Room. They have since shut down. Ground Kontrol has a Karaoke night where they play Garage Band. I also went to meetup.com to find a karaoke group.</p>
